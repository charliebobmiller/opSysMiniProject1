How to run server/client process: 

1) compile and run server.c on your target server machine

2) compile and run client.c on your target client machine

3) Follow in-program instructions and provide input as requested for desired output

NOTE: currently client and server will pass messages between each other, but the remaining menu progression hasnt been integrated yet.
